import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The dependency injection in `flutter_solidart` is done using the [disco](https://disco.mariuti.com) package.

This replaced the `Solid` widget which was used in the previous versions of `flutter_solidart`.

[disco](https://disco.mariuti.com) has been built on top of `Solid` to provide a more powerful and flexible way to handle dependency injection.

[Refer to the official disco documentation](https://disco.mariuti.com) which contains also examples written with `flutter_solidart`

Dependency injection is no longer opinionated in `flutter_solidart` and you can use any dependency injection library you want.

The old `Solid` widget has been removed, and a new library called [disco](https://disco.mariuti.com) has been introduced to handle dependency injection in a more flexible and powerful way.

Our suggestions is to use [disco](https://disco.mariuti.com) for dependency injection in `flutter_solidart` applications, but you're free to use what works best for you.

[disco](https://disco.mariuti.com) has been built on top of `Solid` to provide a more powerful and flexible way to handle dependency injection.

[Refer to the official disco documentation](https://disco.mariuti.com) which contains also examples written with `flutter_solidart`

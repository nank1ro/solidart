A magic widget builder that automatically rebuilds everytime a signal used inside its builder changes.

Reacts to any number of *signals* calling the `builder` each time.

The `builder` argument must not be null.

The `child` is optional but is good practice to use if part of the widget
subtree does not depend on the value of the *signals*.

```dart {9} {13-17}
class SampleCounter extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleCounter({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleCounter> createState() => _SampleCounterState();
}

class _SampleCounterState extends State<SampleCounter> {
  final counter = Signal(0);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SignalBuilder(
      builder: (context, child) {
        return Text(counter.value.toString());
      },
    );
  }
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
By default, if no __active__ signals are detected inside the builder method, an assertion error will be thrown in debug mode.
This is to help catch mistakes where you might have forgotten to use an __active__ signal inside the builder.

There may be cases where you want to disable this behavior, for example if you want it to build with the latest value of a disposed signal, in that case you can use `SolidartConfig.assertSignalBuilderWithoutDependencies = false` before `runApp`.

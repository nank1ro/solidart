<Aside type="tip">**TL;DR**: Always dispose Effects and Observations, the rest will be disposed automatically.</Aside>

By default when you create a `Signal`, `Computed`, `Resource` or `Effect` the library will dispose them automatically.

You can customize this behaviour for a specific trackable Object using the options, for example for a `Signal` you have to create it with `autoDispose` set to `false`.

```dart
final counter = Signal(0, autoDispose: false);
```

If you want to disable it globally instead, use

```dart
SolidartConfig.autoDispose = false;
```

The automatic disposal happens automatically when there are no longer subscribers and listeners (for `Signal`, `Computed`, `Resource`) and when the __currently__ tracked dependencies are all disposed (for `Effect`).

There is a single case that the automatic disposal won't cover:

```dart
final count = Signal(0);

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  Effect(() {
      print("The count is ${count.value}");
    },
  );
}

@override
void dispose() {
  // nothing disposed manually here
  super.dispose();
}
```

In the example above the `count` signal will not be disposed because the `Effect` is a subscriber, and the `Effect` won't be disposed because the `count` that watches is not disposed. So they're going to be alive forever.
In order to fix this we need to dispose the `Effect` manually:

```dart
final count = Signal(0);
late final DisposeEffect disposeEffect;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  disposeEffect = Effect(() {
      print("The count is ${count.value}");
    },
  );
}

@override
void dispose() {
  disposeEffect();
  super.dispose();
}
```

In this case the `count` signal would be disposed because the subscriber is disposed and no longer watches it.
This would work also if you disposed only the `count` instead of the `Effect`.

But I suggest to always dispose the `Effect` because it's always one, but if it is tracking multiple signals, all of them need to be disposed in order for the effect to dispose, for example:

```dart
final count = Signal(0);
final name = Signal('Alex');

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  Effect(() {
      print("The count is ${count.value} and the name is ${name.value}");
    },
  );
}

@override
void dispose() {
  count.dispose();
  name.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

As you can see both the `count` and `name` signals needs to be disposed in order for the `Effect` to dispose.
This is the reason why I suggest to always dispose the `Effect`.

<Aside>The same behavior applies to `Observation`</Aside>

In any case, don't worry to call `dispose()` yourself. It won't produce any error if it's already disposed. It just skips the operation.
In fact in the source code the operation is skipped if the object is already disposed:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // ignore if already disposed
  if (_disposed) return;
  ...
}
```

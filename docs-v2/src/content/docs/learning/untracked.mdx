Execute a callback that will not be tracked by the reactive system.

This can be useful inside Effects or Observations to prevent a signal from being tracked.

## Example

```dart
final count = Signal(0);
final doubleCount = Signal(0);

Effect(() {
  final value = count();
  untracked(() {
    doubleCount.value = value * 2;
  });
});
```

The `Effect` will track only `count` and will not react to the changes of `doubleCount`.

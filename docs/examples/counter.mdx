# Counter example

A very simple example with a counter.

<Zapp id="zy406foy506" />

In this example we've used a `StatefulWidget` because we must not forget to `dispose()` the created signal.
We've used `counter` as our signal name:
```dart
final counter = createSignal(0);
```

Starting it from the `0` value.

In the `dispose()` method we dispose the signal:
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  counter.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

To display the `counter` value we've used a `SignalBuilder` that rebuild any time the `counter` value changes:
```dart
SignalBuilder(
  signal: counter,
  builder: (_, value, __) {
    return Text('$value');
  },
)
```

And finally to update our `counter` value we've used a `FloatingActionButton`:
```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    counter.value++;
  },
  child: const Icon(Icons.add),
)
```

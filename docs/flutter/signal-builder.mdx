# SignalBuilder

A signal widget builder.

Reacts to the `signal` calling the `builder` each time.
The `signal` and `builder` arguments must not be null.
The `child` is optional but is good practice to use if part of the widget
subtree does not depend on the value of the `signal`.

```dart
// sample counter
final counter = createSignal(0);

@override
void dispose() {
  counter.dispose();
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SignalBuilder(
        signal: counter,
        builder: (_, value, __) {
          return Text('$value');
        },
    );
}
```

If you need to nest multiple `SignalBuilder`s you may also check:
- `DualSignalBuilder` to react to __2__ signals at once
- `TripleSignalBuilder` to react to __3__ signals at once.

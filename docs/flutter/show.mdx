# Show

You should typically find yourself in the condition of wanting to render one widget or another based on the state of a signal.

Let's look at a simple example where we show the text 'Logged In' if the user is logged in or 'Logged out'.
```dart
// sample signal that tells if the user is logged in or not
final loggedIn = createSignal(false);

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SignalBuilder(
    signal: loggedIn,
    builder: (context, isUserLoggedIn, child) {
      if (isUserLoggedIn) return const Text('Logged in');
      return const Text('Logged out');
    },
  );
}
```

You may be tempted to use a [SignalBuilder](/flutter/signal-builder) but with the `Show` widget is even simpler:
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Show(
    when: loggedIn,
    builder: (context) => const Text('Logged In'),
    fallback: (context) => const Text('Logged out'),
  );
}
```

The `Show` widget conditionally renders its `builder` or the `fallback` widget based on the `when` evaluation.
The `fallback` widget builder is optional, by default nothing is rendered.

The `Show` widget takes a `Signal` of type `bool`, see [Derived Signals](/learning/derived-signals) to learn how to create a derived signal if your Signal is not of type `bool`.

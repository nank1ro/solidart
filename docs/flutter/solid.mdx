# Solid

The Flutter framework works like a Tree. There are ancestors and there are descendants.

You may incur the need to pass a Signal deep into the tree, this is discouraged.
You should never pass a signal as a parameter.

To avoid this there's the _Solid_ widget.

With this widget you can pass a signal down the tree to anyone who needs it.

You will have already seen `Theme.of(context)` or `MediaQuery.of(context)`, the procedure is practically the same.

Let's see an example to grasp the concept.

You're going to see how to build a toggle theme feature using `Solid`, this example is present also [here](/examples/toggle-theme)

```dart
/// The identifiers used for [Solid] signals.
enum SignalId { // [1]
  themeMode,
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Provide the theme mode signal to descendats
    return Solid( // [2]
      signals: {
          // the id of the signal and the signal associated.
        SignalId.themeMode: () => createSignal<ThemeMode>(ThemeMode.light),
      },
      child:
          // using a builder here because the `context` must be a descendant of [Solid]
          Builder(
        builder: (context) {
          // observe the theme mode value this will rebuild every time the themeMode signal changes.
          final themeMode = context.observe<ThemeMode>(SignalId.themeMode); // [3]
          return MaterialApp(
            title: 'Toggle theme',
            themeMode: themeMode,
            theme: ThemeData.light(),
            darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
            home: const MyHomePage(),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // retrieve the theme mode signal
    final themeMode = context.get<Signal<ThemeMode>>(SignalId.themeMode); // [4]
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Toggle theme'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child:
            // Listen to the theme mode signal rebuilding only the IconButton
            SignalBuilder( // [5]
          signal: themeMode,
          builder: (_, mode, __) {
            return IconButton(
              onPressed: () { // [6]
                // toggle the theme mode
                if (themeMode.value == ThemeMode.light) {
                  themeMode.value = ThemeMode.dark;
                } else {
                  themeMode.value = ThemeMode.light;
                }
              },
              icon: Icon(
                mode == ThemeMode.light ? Icons.dark_mode : Icons.light_mode,
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example many things occured, first at `[1]` we've used an _Enum_ to store all the [SignalId]s.
You may use a `String`, an `int` or wethever you want. Just be sure to use the same id to retrieve the signal.

Then at `[2]` we've used the `Solid` widget to provide the `themeMode` signal to descendants.

The `Solid` widgets takes a Map of `signals`:

- The key of the Map is the signal id, in this case `SignalId.themeMode`.
- The value of the Map is a function that returns a `SignalBase`. You may create a signal or a derived signal. The value is a Function because the signal is created lazily only when used for the first time, if you never access the signal it never gets created.

At `[3]` we `observe` the value of a signal. The `observe` method listen to the signal value and rebuilds the widget when the value changes. It takes an `id` that is the signal identifier that you want to use. This method must be called only inside the `build` method.

At `[4]` we `get` the signal with the given `id`. This doesn't listen to signal value. You may use this method inside the `initState` and `build` methods.

At `[5]` using the `SignalBuilder` widget we rebuild the `IconButton` every time the signal value changes.

And finally at `[6]` we update the signal value.

> It is mandatory to pass the type of signal value otherwise you're going to encounter an error, for example:

1. `createSignal<ThemeMode>` and `context.observe<ThemeMode>` where ThemeMode is the type of the signal value.
2. `context.get<Signal<ThemeMode>>` where `Signal<ThemeMode>` is the type of signal with its type value.

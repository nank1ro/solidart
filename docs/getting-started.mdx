# Getting started

The library is made up of three packages:
1. [solidart](/getting-started#solidart)
2. [flutter_solidart](/getting-started#flutter_solidart)
2. [solidart_lint](/getting-started#solidart_lint)

## solidart

This package is meant to be used only in Dart applications.

### Install

Run this command in the root of your project:
```sh
dart pub add solidart
```

### Import it

```dart
import 'package:solidart/solidart.dart';
```

## flutter_solidart

This package extends the functionatilies of `solidart` and is meant to be used only in Flutter applications.

### Install

Run this command in the root of your project:
```sh
flutter pub add flutter_solidart
```

### Import it

```dart
import 'package:flutter_solidart/flutter_solidart.dart';
```

## solidart_lint

This package is a developer tool for users of flutter_solidart, designed to help stop common issues and simplify repetitive tasks.
<Success>I highly recommend using this package to avoid errors and understand how to properly use flutter_solidart</Success>

### Install

Run this command in the root of your Flutter project:
```sh
flutter pub add -d solidart_lint custom_lint
```

Then edit your `analysis_options.yaml` file and add these lines of code:
```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint
```

Then run:
```sh
rm pubspec.lock
flutter clean
flutter pub get
dart run custom_lint
```

### Update lints (suggested)

You may also update the `analysis_options.yaml` rules to work well with solidart.
```yaml
linter:
  rules:
    use_late_for_private_fields_and_variables: false
    implicit_call_tearoffs: false
```

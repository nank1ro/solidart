# Overview

`solidart` is a free Open Source state-management library for Dart and Flutter applications.

It is inspired by SolidJS and shares some common concepts.

The objectives of this library are:
- Being simple and easy to learn
- Do not go against the framework (e.g. Flutter) with weird workarounds.
- Do not have a single state, but put multiple states only in the most appropriate places

# Effects

Signals are trackable values, but they are only one half of the equation. To complement those are observers that can be updated by those trackable values. An effect is one such observer; it runs a side effect that depends on signals.

An effect can be created by using `createEffect`.
The effect automatically subscribes to any signal and reruns when any of them change.

So let's create an Effect that reruns whenever `counter` changes:
```dart
// sample signal
final counter = createSignal(0);

// effect creation
final disposeFn = createEffect((_) {
    print("The count is now ${counter.value}");
});

// The effect run immediately and prints `The count is now 0`;

// increment the counter
counter.value++;

// The effect prints `The count is now 1`;
```

The `createEffect` method returns a `Dispose` callback, invoke it to stop listening and clearing the effect.
```dart
final disposeFn = createEffect((disposeFn) {
    print("The count is now ${counter.value}");
});

// Somewhere else, dispose the effect
disposeFn();
```

<Info>The effect runs immediately with the current signals' values</Info>

<Error>An effect is useless after it is disposed, you must not use it anymore.</Error>

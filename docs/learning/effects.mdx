# Effects

Signals are trackable values, but they are only one half of the equation. To complement those are observers that can be updated by those trackable values. An effect is one such observer; it runs a side effect that depends on signals.

An effect can be created by using `createEffect`.
The effect subscribes to any signal provided in the signals array and reruns when any of them change.

So let's create an `Effect` that reruns whenever `counter` changes:
```dart
// sample signal
final counter = createCounter(0);

// effect creation
createEffect(() {
    print("The count is now ${counter.value}");
}, signals: [counter]);

// increment the counter
counter.value++;

// The effect prints `The count is now 1`;
```

<Info>The effect automatically cancels when all the `signals` provided dispose</Info>

The `createEffect` method returns an `Effect` class giving you a more advanced usage:
```dart
final effect = createEffect(() {
    print("The count is now ${counter.value}");
}, signals: [counter], fireImmediately: true);

print(effect.isRunning); // prints true

// pause effect
effect.pause();

print(effect.isPaused); // prints true

// resume effect
effect.resume();

print(effect.isResumed); // prints true

// cancel effect
effect.cancel();

print(effect.isCancelled); // prints true
```

The `fireImmediately` flag indicates if the effect sould run immediately with the current `signals` values, defaults to false.

You may want to `pause`, `resume` or `cancel` an effect.

<Error>An effect is useless after it is cancelled, you must not use it anymore.</Error>

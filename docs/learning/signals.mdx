# Signals

Signals are the cornerstone of reactivity in `solidart`. They contain values that change over time; when you change a signal's value, it automatically updates anything that uses it.

To create a signal, let's import createSignal and call it like this:
<Tabs
  groupId="library"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flutter', value: 'flutter' },
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]}
>
 <TabItem value="flutter">
    Import the `flutter_solidart` package:
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_solidart/flutter_solidart.dart';
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dart">
    Import the `solidart` package:

    ```dart
    import 'package:solidart/solidart.dart';
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next create the signal with:

```dart
final counter = createSignal(0);
````

The argument passed to the create call is the initial value, and the return value is the signal.

To retrieve the current signal value use:
```dart
counter.value; // 0
// or
counter(); // 0
```

To update the current signal value you can use:
```dart
counter.value++; // increase by 1
// or 
counter.value = 5; // sets the value to 5
// or 
counter.update((v) => v * 2); // update based on the current value
```

<Warning>Don't forget to call the `dispose()` method when you no longer need the signal.</Warning>
```dart
counter.dispose();
```

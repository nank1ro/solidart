# ResourceBuilder API docs

Reacts to the __resource__ calling the __builder__ each time.

```dart
final counter = Resource(
  fetcher: () => Future.value(1),
);

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ResourceBuilder(
    resource: counter,
    builder: (context, counterState) {
      return switch (userState) {
        ResourceReady(:final value) => Text(value),
        ResourceError(:final error, :final stackTrace) =>
          Text('$error, $stackTrace'),
        ResourceLoading() => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      }
    },
  );
}
```

## Constructor

ResourceBuilder({
  required Resource<T> resource,
  required ResourceWidgetBuilder<T> builder,
});
```

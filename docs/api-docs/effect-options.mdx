# EffectOptions API docs

The options of an effect.

## Constructor

```dart
const EffectOptions({
  String? name,
  Duration? delay,
  bool autoDispose = true,
});
```

## name

The name of the effect, useful for logging purposes.

## delay

Delay each effect reaction.
Instead of running the effect immediately, run after the specified duration.

## autoDispose

Whether to automatically dispose the effect (defaults to true).

This happens automatically when all the tracked dependencies are disposed.
If you set it to false, you should remember to dispose the effect manually

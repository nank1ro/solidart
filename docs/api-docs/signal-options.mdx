# SignalOptions API docs

Signal options which increase its customization.

## Constructor

```dart
const SignalOptions({
  this.name,
  this.equals = false,
  this.comparator = identical,
  this.autoDispose = true,
});
```


### name

The name of the signal, useful for logging purposes.

### equals

Whether to check the equality of the value with the == equality.

Preventing signal updates if the new value is equal to the previous.

When this value is true, the [comparator] is not used.

### comparator

An optional comparator function, defaults to [identical].

Preventing signal updates if the [comparator] returns true.

Taken into account only if [equals] is false.

### autoDispose

Whether to automatically dispose the signal (defaults to true).

This happens automatically when there are no longer subscribers.
If you set it to false, you should remember to dispose the signal manually

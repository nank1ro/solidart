# SignalOptions API docs

Signal options which increase its customization.

## Constructor

```dart
const SignalOptions({
  this.name,
  this.equals = false,
  this.comparator = identical,
  this.autoDispose = true,
});
```


### name

The name of the signal, useful for logging purposes.

### equals

Whether to check the equality of the value with the == equality.

Preventing signal updates if the new value is equal to the previous.

When this value is true, the __comparator__ is not used.

### comparator

An optional comparator function, defaults to __identical__.

Preventing signal updates if the __comparator__ returns true.

Taken into account only if __equals__ is false.

### autoDispose

Whether to automatically dispose the signal (defaults to true).

This happens automatically when there are no longer subscribers.
If you set it to false, you should remember to dispose the signal manually

# Effect API docs

Signals are trackable values, but they are only one half of the equation.
To complement those are observers that can be updated by those trackable values. An effect is one such observer; it runs a side effect that depends on signals.

An effect can be created by using `Effect`.
The effect subscribes automatically to any signal used in the callback and reruns when any of them change.

## Constructor

```dart
Effect(
  void Function(DisposeEffect dispose) callback, {
    ErrorCallback? onError,
    EffectOptions options = const EffectOptions(),
  }
);
```

`callback` is the function used to run the effect and tracks all the signals used.

`options` are the [options](/api-docs/effect-options) of the effect.

```dart
final count = Signal(1);
final doubleCount = Computed(() => count() * 2);
print(doubleCount()); // prints 2
count.set(2);
print(doubleCount()); // prints 4
```

## disposed 

Returns `true` if the effect has been disposed.

## dispose()

Disposes the effect.
If the effect has already been disposed, this method does nothing.

Removes the subscriber from all the tracked signals.

```dart
final count = Signal(0);
final effect = Effect((_) {
  print("The count is ${count.value}");
});
effect.dispose(); // disposes the effect
```

## call()

Disposes the effect, like above.

```dart
final count = Signal(0);
final disposeEffect = Effect((_) {
  print("The count is ${count.value}");
});
disposeEffect(); // disposes the effect
```

> An`Effect` only tracks the __current__ dependencies.

```dart
final name = Signal("John");
final lastName = Signal("Doe");
final showFullName = Signal(false);

Effect((_) {
  if (showFullName()) {
    print("${name.value} ${lastName.value}");
  } else {
    print(name.value);
  }
});
```

In the case above the Effect prints `John` because `showFullName` is `false`.
If you try to change the `lastName` to `Smith`, the effect won't react because is not tracking `lastName`.

If you set `showFullName` to `true`, the effect will print `John Doe` and will track both the `name` and the `lastName`.

<Info>Use conditional logic carefully when using `Effect`.</Info>

# SignalBuilder API docs

Reacts to the __signal__ calling the __builder__ each time.

```dart
final counter = Signal(0);

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SignalBuilder(
    signal: counter,
    builder: (context, value, child) {
      return Text('$value');
    },
  );
}
```

## Constructor

```dart
SignalBuilder({
  required SignalBase<T> signal,
  required ValueWidgetBuilder<T> builder,
  Widget? child,
});
```

`signal` The signal whose value you depend on in order to build. This widget does not ensure that the signal's value is not null, therefore your __builder__ may need to handle null values.

`builder` is the function that builds the widget with the current value of the signal.

`child` is optional and can be null if the entire widget subtree the __builder__ builds depends on the value of the __signal__. This widget will be passed to the `builder` and __DOESN'T__ rebuilds if the value of the __signal__ changes.

<Info>See also __DualSignalBuilder__and __TripleSignalBuilder__ to react to multiple signals</Info>

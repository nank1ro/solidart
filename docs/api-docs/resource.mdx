# Resource API docs

`Resource`s are special `Signal`s designed specifically to handle __Async__
loading. Their purpose is wrap async values in a way that makes them easy
to interact with handling the common states of a future or stream __data__, __error__ and __loading__.

A __Resource__ extends a [Signal](/api-docs/signal), so all the API of __Signal__ are available.

## Constructor

```dart
Resource({
  Future<T> Function()? fetcher,
  Stream<T>? Function()? stream,
  ResourceOptions? options,
  SignalBase<dynamic>? source,
});
```

`fetcher` is the function that returns a `Future`.
`stream` is the function that returns a `Stream`.
`options` are the [options](/api-docs/resource-options) of the resource.
`source` is the query to the async data `fetcher` or `stream` function that triggers the resource everytime it changes.

## ResourceState<T> get state

Returns the current state of the resource.
See [ResourceState](/api-docs/resource-state) for more details.

## ResourceState<T> get previousState

Returns the previous state of the resource.
See [ResourceState](/api-docs/resource-state) for more details.

## Future<void> refresh()

Forces a refresh of the resource.

## Resource<Selected> select<Selected>(Selected Function(T data) selector, { String? name })

Filters the `Resource`'s data by reading only the properties that you care about.

The advantage is that you keep handling the loading and error states.

## FutureOr<T> untilReady()

Returns a future that completes with the value when the Resource is ready
If the resource is already ready, it completes immediately.

## ResourceState<T> update(ResourceState<T> Function(ResourceState<T> state) callback)

Calls a function with the current [state] and assigns the result as the new state.

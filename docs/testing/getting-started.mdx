# Getting started

Writing tests is simple, if you already know how to test a Flutter app you're almost ready.

If you don't know how to test Flutter apps head hover to [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing)

Check how I tested the examples that I provided:
- [Testing the counter](/examples/counter#testing)
- [Testing the toggle theme](/examples/toggle-theme#testing)
- [Testing the todos](/examples/todos#testing)
